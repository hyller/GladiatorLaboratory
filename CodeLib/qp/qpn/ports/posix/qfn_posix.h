/* NOTES: ********************************************************************
*
* NOTE1:
* QF-nano, like all small real-time kernels, needs to disable and enable
* interrupts to execute critical sections of code atomically. However,
* POSIX does not really allow disabling/enabling interrutps at the task
* level. Instead, this QF-nano emulation uses therefore a single package-scope
* p-thread mutex QF_pThreadMutex_ to protect all critical sections. The mutex
* is locked upon the entry to each critical sectioni and unlocked upon exit.
*
* Using the single mutex for all crtical section guarantees that only one
* thread at a time can execute inside a critical section. This prevents race
* conditions and data corruption.
*
* Note, however, that the mutex implementation of a critical section behaves
* differently than the standard interrupt locking. For example, the mutex
* approach might be subject to priority inversions. However, most p-thread
* mutex implementations, such as Linux p-threads, should support the
* priority-inheritance protocol.
