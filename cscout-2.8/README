CScout is a source code analyzer and refactoring browser for collections
of C programs.  It can process workspaces of multiple projects (we define
a project as a collection of C source files that are linked together)
mapping the complexity introduced by the C preprocessor back into
the original C source code files.  CScout takes advantage of modern
hardware advances (fast processors and large memory capacities) to
analyze C source code beyond the level of detail and accuracy provided
by  current compilers and linkers.  The analysis CScout performs takes
into account the identifier scopes introduced by the C preprocessor and
the C language proper scopes and namespaces.  CScout has already been
applied on projects of tens of thousands of lines to millions of lines,
like the Linux, OpenSolaris, and FreeBSD kernels, and the Apache web
server.

This free unsupported version of CScout is distributed under the terms
of the CScout Public License, which is available in the accompanying
documentation.
