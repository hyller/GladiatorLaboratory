QCLEAN Application ReadMe
=========================
QCLEAN is a command-line utility to perform cleanup of various
source files, such as C/C++ code, ASM code, makefiles, batch
scripts, HTML, XML, QM models, and some others.

QCLEAN performs the following cleanup:

1. Replaces all tabs with strings of spaces (except the leading
   tabs in makefiles)
2. Removes all white space (spaces and tabs) at the end of lines
3. Enforces the Unix end-of-line convention (replaces \r\n with
   \n)

The main benefit of using QCLEAN is to maintain clean source code.
Clean source code is easier to display consistently in various code
editors, even accross different development platforms (such as
Windows, Linux, or Mac), and is easier to manage in various version
control systems (VCS). The differences between versions of clean
code do not show false-positve differences in the invisible white
space only. Also, the QCLEAN utility helps enforce the Quantum Leaps
coding convention.  

QCLEAN is pre-compiled and ready to use on Windows and Linux/Unix.
Source code is also provided.

NOTE: you might want to add the directory <qutils>\bin\ containing
the qclean executable to the PATH variable on your system.

NOTE: On Linux/Unix, you need to additionally make sure that the file
qclean is executable in order to run it. You can either do this with
your desktop's file manager or, at the command line, type:

chmod u+x qclean


USAGE
-----
Typically, you use QCLEAN by changing to the root directory of the
tree you want to clean, and invoking QCLEAN without paramterers.
QCLEAN then cleans recursively all folders below the current direcory.

Alternatively, you can invoke QCLEAN with a single parameter, which
is the root directory to be cleaned.

qclean [<root_dir>]

The QCLEAN utility only attempts to clean writable files with the
extensions it knows, and applies the cleanup appropriate to the
given extension (e.g., QCLEAN won't remove leading tabs in makefiles).
Files that don't need cleanup are not altered in any way.
