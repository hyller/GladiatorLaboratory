Date:               September 11. 2013
Build:              14160
Hardware supported: 0.4 beta, 1.2, 1.3

* An Arduino-like API (see hal.h) is now used to access IO etc. so Arduino users should feel right at home.

Known bugs:
* ENCRYPTION_MISMATCH error is often seen on remote connections.
* LED doesn't work on board version 1.3.

Build:              13584
Hardware supported: 0.4 beta, 1.2, 1.3

* Added support for Nabduino hardware version 1.3.
* Removed software filtering of analog inputs for hardware version 1.3 (source of the noise was removed on hardware version 1.3).

Build:              12693
Hardware supported: 0.4 beta, 1.2

* Optimized crypto to reduce RAM usage - this also killed of the unabto_stack module.
* Restructured source files to make things more logical.

Known bugs:
* Temperature sensor is a bit noisy.

Date:               August 10. 2012
Build:              10372
Hardware supported: 0.4 beta, 1.2

* Added support for hardware revision 1.2.
* Changes to PWM outputs:
*   Revision 0.4 beta has PWM outputs on IO pins 10, 11 and non-standard IO
    pin 14.
*   Revision 1.2+ has PWM outputs on IO pins 3, 5, 6, 10 and 11 (IO pin 14
    was removed on rev. 1.2+ to be compatible with Arduino shields).

Known bugs:
* Temperature sensor is a bit noisy.

Date:               April 17. 2012
Build:              9546
Hardware supported: 0.4 beta

* All digital IO pins now work.
* Temperature sensor now works but the temperature value fluctuates a bit.

Known bugs:
* Temperature sensor is a bit noisy.
* PWM outputs 0 through 2 do not work. Any attempts to set them are simply
  ignored.

Date:               March 7. 2012
Build:              9378
Hardware supported: 0.4 beta

* PWM outputs 3 through 5 now work. PWM outputs 0 through 2 still only
  functions as digital IOs due to hardware restrictions. This will be fixed
  on later hardware revisions.
* Analog inputs now read correctly.
  Values are now presented as millivolts instead of the raw ADC value.

Known bugs:
* Temperature sensor isn't working properly.
* PWM outputs 0 through 2 do not work. Any attempts to set them are simply
  ignored.
* Digital IO State flag isn't working properly.
