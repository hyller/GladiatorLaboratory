<h1>Installation and Setup</h1>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
To run <em>CScout</em> your system must satisfy the following
requirements:
<ul>
<li> Have an installation of the <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>
interpreter
<li> Contain the include files of the compiler your programs use
<!-- (unless your programs only include the ANSI C include files from
the system's include directory) -->
<li> Support a Web browser (text or graphics-based).
<em>CScout</em> uses vanilla HTML and has been tested with
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Mozilla, Safari,
the Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Lynx.
<li> (Optional, needed only for displaying call and dependency graphs.)
Have an installation of the AT&amp;T
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org">GraphViz</a> <em>dot</em>
program in the executable file path, and a Web browser supporting,
directly or via a plugin, the display of SVG (scalable vector graphics)
content.
<li> Be able to retrieve Web content from the Internet without a proxy<br>
(The free unsupported version of <em>CScout</em> will `phone home' when run
on relatively large workspaces, registering the workspace for
public browsing, while your <em>CScout</em> is running.
Only file list and source-code browsing facilities are provided to the
public;
source modification, option changes, and the resource-hungry
identifier queries are only allowed when accessing <em>CScout</em>
from the local host.)
</ul>

<h2>Installation and Configuration</h2>
From this point onward we use the term Unix to refer to Unix-like systems
like GNU/Linux and FreeBSD, and Windows to refer to Microsoft Windows
systems.
<p>
You install <em>CScout</em> in eight steps:
<ol>
<li> Unpack the distribution file on your system.
<p>

<li> Copy the executable files
<code>cscout</code>, <code>cswc</code> and <code>csmake</code> (under Unix) or
<code>cscout.exe</code>, <code>cswc.bat</code> and <code>csmake.bat</code> (under Windows)
from the <code>bin</code> directory
into a directory that is part of your path.
Under Unix <code>/usr/local/bin</code> is a common suitable choice.
Under Windows <code>C:\WINNT\system32</code> is a location
you could use, if your system is not better organized.
<p>

<li> Under Windows adjust the second line of the file
<code>cswc.bat</code> and <code>csmake.bat</code>
to point to the directory where you installed the corresponding file.
<p>

<li> Copy the directory <code>etc</code> to the
final installation place you prefer (renaming it, if you wish),
and arrange for the environment variable <code>CSCOUT_HOME</code>
to point to it.
As an example, under Unix you would probably have the directory
installed as <code>/usr/local/etc/cscout</code>.
Under Unix, you can permanently set the <code>CSCOUT_HOME</code>
environment variable by editing a file named
<code>.profile</code> (sh and derivative shells)
or
<code>.login</code> (csh and derivative shells)
in your home directory.
Under Windows (NT, 2000, XP, and later editions),
you can set environment variables through an option in:
Control Panel - System - Advanced - Environment Variables.
<p>
Alternativelly, the contents of the directory <code>etc</code>
will be searched in
<code>$HOME/.cscout</code>,
<code>%APPDATA%/.cscout</code> (under Windows; it will be something like
<code>C:\Documents and Settings\Your Name\Application Data</code>),
and
the current directory's <code>.cscout</code> directory.
<p>

<li> Go in the <em>CScout</em> etc directory and copy
the file pair <code>cscout_incs.PLATFORM</code> and
<code>cscout_defs.PLATFORM</code>
(where PLATFORM is the operating system and the compiler
that most closely resemble your setup)
as <code>cscout_incs.h</code> and <code>cscout_defs.h</code>.
<p>
In most cases you want <em>CScout</em> to process your code using
the include files of the compiler you are normally using.
This will allow <em>CScout</em> to handle programs using the libraries
and facilities available in your environment
(e.g. Unix system calls or the Windows API).
If your programs are written in ANSI C and do not use any additional
include files, you can use the .GENERIC files and rely on the
include files supplied with the <em>CScout</em> distribution.
<p>

<li> If you decided to use the <code>.GENERIC</code> files
copy the <code>include</code> directory to an appropriate location
(e.g. <code>/usr/local/include/cscout</code> under Unix).
<p>

<li> Edit the file <code>cscout_incs.h</code> to specify the location
where your compiler's (or the generic) include files reside.
<p>

<li> If the compiler you are using does not match any of the
files supplied, start with the <code>.GENERIC</code> file set and
add suitable definitions to sidestep the problems caused by the
extensions your compiler supports.
As an example,
if your compiler supports a <code>quad_double</code> type and associated
keyword with semantics roughly equivalent to <code>double</code>
you would add a line in <code>cscout_incs</code>:
<pre>
#define quad_double double
</pre>
Have a look in the existing <code>cscout_defs</code> files to see
what might be required.

</ol>

Note that
there is nothing magical about the installation steps described above;
feel free to follow them in whatever way matches your setup and environment,
as long as you achieve the desired results.
