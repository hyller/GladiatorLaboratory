/* NOTES: ********************************************************************
*
* NOTE1:
* QF-nano, like all real-time kernels, needs to execute certain sections of
* code indivisibly to avoid data corruption. The most straightforward way of
* protecting such critical sections of code is disabling and enabling
* interrupts, which Win32 does not allow.
*
* This QF-nano port uses internally a single Win32 critical section object
* (Win32 type CRITICAL_SECTION) to protect all critical sections.
*
* Using the single critical section object for all crtical section guarantees
* that only one thread at a time can execute inside a critical section. This
* prevents race conditions and data corruption.
*
* Please note, however, that the Win32 critical section implementation
* behaves differently than interrupt disabling. For example, the Win32
* critical section can potentially be subject to priority inversions. Various
* versions of Windows handle priority inversions differently, but it seems
* that most of them recognize priority inversions and dynamically adjust the
* priorities of threads to prevent it. Please refer to the MSN articles for
* more information.
