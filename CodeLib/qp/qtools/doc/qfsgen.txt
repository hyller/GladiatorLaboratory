QFSGEN Application ReadMe
=========================
QFSGEN is a command-line utility to generate ROM-based file
systems for your embedded web pages. QFSGEN converts all files
in a given directory into a .H include file that stores the
data from your original files as constant arrays of chars.

QFSGEN is pre-compiled and ready to use on Windows and Linux/Unix.

On Windows, the QFSGEN executable is located in:

    <qfsgen-intall-dir>\win32\mingw\rel\qfsgen.exe

On Linux, the QFSGEN executable is located in:

    <qfsgen-intall-dir>\linux\gnu\rel\qfsgen

Where <qfsgen-intall-dir> stands for the directory name, where
you installed QFSGEN.

NOTE: you might want to add the directory containing the QFSGEN
executable to the PATH variable on your system.

NOTE: On Linux/Unix, you need to make the file qfsgn executable
in order to run it. You can either do this with your desktop's
file manager or, at the command line, type:

chmod u+x qfsgen


USAGE
-----
Let's assume that you have prepared your website in a subdirectory
fs\ inside directory webserver\

 +-webserver\
   |
   +-fs\
   | +-img\
   | | +-pic1.jpg
   | | +-pic2.gif
   | |   . . .
   | |     
   | +-index.html
   | +-style.css
   |   . . .


If you invoke the QFSGEN utility from the level of directory
webserver\, it will process the files in the subdirectory fs\
and generate file fsdata.h in the directory webserver\.

You can change the default names of the root-directory (fs\) and
the output file name (fsdata.h) by means of command line parameters.

Usage: qfsgen [root-dir [output-file]] [-h]
      -h suppresses generation of the HTTP headers

Additionally, the command-line switch -h suppresses generation of the
HTML headers for the files. If you use the -h option, the files will
be converted exactly as they are, without prepending the HTTP headers
to them. The HTTP headers are prepended to files by default.
