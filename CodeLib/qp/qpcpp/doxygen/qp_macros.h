/// \brief The preprocessor switch to disable checking assertions
///
/// When defined, Q_NASSERT disables the following macros #Q_ASSERT,
/// #Q_REQUIRE, #Q_ENSURE, #Q_INVARIANT, #Q_ERROR as well as
/// #Q_ASSERT_ID, #Q_REQUIRE_ID, #Q_ENSURE_ID, #Q_INVARIANT_ID, and
/// #Q_ERROR_ID do NOT evaluate the test condition passed as the
/// argument to these macros.
///
/// \note One notable exception is the macro #Q_ALLEGE, that still
/// evaluates the test condition, but does not report assertion
/// failures when the switch Q_NASSERT is defined.
#define Q_NASSERT


/// \brief The preprocessor switch to activate the QS software tracing
/// instrumentation in the code
///
/// When defined, Q_SPY activates the QS software tracing instrumentation.
/// When Q_SPY is not defined, the QS instrumentation in the code does
/// not generate any code.

/// \brief The preprocessor switch to disable the use of the QP::
/// namespace in the QP/C++ code
///
/// \note The use of namespaces is required by the required MISRA:C++-2008
/// rule 7-3-1 and also many other rules concerned with scope.

/// \brief This macro defines the type of the OS-Object used for blocking
/// the native QF event queue when the queue is empty
///
/// In QK, the OS object is used to hold the per-thread flags, which might
/// be used, for example, to remember the thread attributes (e.g.,
/// if the thread uses a floating point co-processor). The OS object value
/// is set on per-thread basis in QActive::start(). Later, the extended
/// context switch macros (QK_EXT_SAVE() and QK_EXT_RESTORE()) might use
/// the per-thread flags to determine what kind of extended context switch
/// this particular thread needs (e.g., the thread might not be using the
/// coprocessor or might be using a different one).
#define QF_OS_OBJECT_TYPE  uint8_t

/// \brief This macro defines the type of the thread handle used for the
/// active objects.
///
/// The thread type in QK is the pointer to the thread-local storage (TLS)
/// This thread-local storage can be set on per-thread basis in
/// QActive::start(). Later, the QK scheduler, passes the pointer to the
/// thread-local storage to the macro #QK_TLS.

/// task when the QF native queue is empty

/// of QF. QK never activates a task that has no events to process, so in this
/// case the macro asserts that the queue is not empty. In other QF ports you
// need to define the macro appropriately for the underlying kernel/OS you're
/// using.

/// active object task that an event has just arrived.
///
/// The macro is necessary only when the native QF event queue is used.
/// The signaling of task involves unblocking the task if it is blocked.

/// \note #QACTIVE_EQUEUE_SIGNAL_ is called from a critical section.
/// It might leave the critical section internally, but must restore
/// the critical section before exiting to the caller.
