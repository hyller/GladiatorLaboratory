Short description of the uNabto SDK structure.

* Documentation:
The Nabto documentation is located at "http://nabto.com/documentation" ,
where the basics of the Nabto platform is explained. This is a good
place to start!

* Source code:
The "unabto/src" directory contains the uNabto framework source code and
device specific config files.

* Demo code:
The "unabto/demo" directory contains uNabto examples for different
platforms (e.g. Windows, Unix, Microchip, Arduino, etc.).

* Contrib code:
The "unabto/contrib" directory contains contributed uNabto
demos. These demos are not officially maintained this means that the
projects can be outdated and probably does not work out of the box. If
you need help with a contrib demo you should feel free to contact
support@nabto.com

* Other:
"unabto/build/cmake/unabto_files.cmake" sets the build environment used by
some of the demos.
"unabto/external" is where you put all uNabto externals.
"projects" directory is used by the nabduino bootloader.
