This example fails to link correctly due to the limitations
of the Open Watcom C++ compiler for DOS in setting the
compiler options for C++ and C (which must be used to 
compile uC/OS-II). However, the QP/C++ port to uC/OS-II and
even this example application code are correct and can be
used as a starting point for developing your own QP/C++
applications with uC/OS-II.
