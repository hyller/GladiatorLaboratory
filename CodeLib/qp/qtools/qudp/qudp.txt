QUDP Application ReadMe
=======================
QUDP is a simple command-line utility for testing the UDP
connectivity to and from an embedded device running a UDP/IP
stack.

The QUDP utility allows you to send UDP packets to a given IP
address and port number and also receive UDP packets at a
given local port number. All UDP packets are interpreted and
displayed as ASCII text.

QUDP is pre-compiled and ready to use on Windows. Source code
is also provided.

NOTE: you might want to add the directory <qutils>\bin\ containing
the qudp executable to the PATH variable on your system.


USAGE
-----
You invoke QUDP as follows

qudp <ip-addr> [<port> [<local port>]]

where <ip-addr> is the IP address of the remote node. The optional
paramter <port> is the remote port number. If not specified, remote
port of 777 is used. The optional paramter <local port> is the local
port at which the QUDP listens to replies. If not specified, the
default local port of 1777 is used.

example:

C:>qudp 192.168.0.1
qudp utility 1.1.00 (c) Quantum Leaps, www.state-machine.com
Opening and binding local socket at port=1777...ready
Remote UDP connection: IP-address=192.168.0.1, port=777
